Save Zortan:
------------

The war has just intensified, Thanos army has reach Zortan and are going to
fight along with him. With his army, this time Thanos is going to attach Avengers
and the battle is going to be intense!!!

Since, everything is going in real-time, we don't have control over characters,
instead our characters will choose their own fight.

This time each character gets it own structure and defined parameters, so as you
can see our code is getting better and certainly we are going to make is awesome
as we progress with future modules.
