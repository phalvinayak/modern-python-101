"""

Tuple:
------
Time for Louis to go to school, and its time for him to
choose subjects. School doesn't want students to change
subjects after they are chosen, so they use Tuple.

Tuple is like a stricter brother of List. Once a Tuple is
created, it cannot be edited.

Info:
-----
Tuple also start from index 0
