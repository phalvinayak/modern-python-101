Zortan is under attack!!! Thanos has arrived!
---------------------------------------------

Since Zortan is under attack, Louis calls his Avenger friends from earth.
Avengers receive his call and sends 4 avengers to save Zortan.

1. Ironman
4. Black Widow
2. Spiderman
3. Hulk

Each avenger has its attacking power and they have to fight Thanos
to save Zortan.

Avengers can attack only in pairs and get only 3 chances to kill Thanos,
or else Thanos will kill avengers and we loose the game.
